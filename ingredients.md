so before we get started,let me tell you the ingredients
So,they are:
1.Wheat(atta)-3 tablespoon
2.sugar-2 tablespoon
3.coco powder-1 tablespoon
4.oil-1 tablespoon
5.baking powder-1/4 teaspoon
6.milk-4 tablespoon

Decoration:
choco chips-1 tablespoon (for crunchiness in the batter))
you can also take some choco chips for potting on the mug cake.

NOTE: 
-Always add milk according to the consistency
-Cake batter should be quite fluffy but thick. It should not be runny or watery, but very puffy-like.
-Also, when you taste cake batter, it has to be sweeter than what you want, as baking does remove a lot of the sweetness as the water evaporates.
